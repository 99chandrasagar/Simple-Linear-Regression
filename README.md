LabCapsule 2 Linear _ Polynomial Regression

Simple Linear Regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between single independent variable with one dependent variable. It finds a linear funcion that maps dependent variable y as a function of independent variable x. (Wikipedia)

Usually the function is written as
y=mx+c
or alternatively,
y=θ1x+θ0

The project has the following tasks:

Understand the data that you are going to work with and convert it to a data frame.
Prepare the data for building the model.
Create and build the machine learning model.
Visualize the results
Measure the performance of the model.
